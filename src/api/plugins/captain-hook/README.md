-   All Plugins to at least return an Object with a `receive` method that takes, `req`, `res` and `next`
    -   Returning with `next` from a plugin allows other plugins to consume the event if necessary
        -   A good example of this would be Stream & Combase, `CombaseRoutingPlugin` calls next so that `StreamWebhookPlugin` can still consume the `channel.created` event if necessary.
    -   Returning with `res` stops the chain - with this in mind, plugin order in the config file can be important depending on your setup.
-   Plugins provided in a similar way to gatsby plugins.
-   Super-lightweight, zero-deps.
